Hi, I am Chunjong "CJ" Park. I am a software enginner at Google Research. My research interests lie in the intersection of mobile health, AI/ML, and HCI. I am specifically interested in empowering commodity mobile devices with novel health sensing capabilities, improving the reliability and usability of such mobile health applications for a broader user population, and drawing meaningful personal-/population-level health insights.

Prior to Google, I received PhD in Computer Science and Engineering at the <a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu/">University of Washington</a>, where I worked with <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~shwetak/">Shwetak Patel</a> in the <a href="https://ubicomplab.cs.washington.edu">Ubiquitous Computing Lab</a>. I recieved BS and MS in Computer Science at <a href="http://cs.kaist.ac.kr/">KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology)</a>, where I worked with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/wewantsj/">Sung-Ju Lee</a>, <a href="https://juhokim.com/">Juho Kim</a>, <a href="https://nclab.kaist.ac.kr/professor_page.html">Junehwa Song</a>, and <a href="http://an.kaist.ac.kr/~sbmoon/">Sue Moon</a>.
