Hi, I'm Chunjong "CJ" Park. I am a PhD student in Computer Science and Engineering, working with <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~shwetak/">Shwetak Patel</a> in the <a href="https://ubicomplab.cs.washington.edu">Ubiquitous Computing Lab</a> at the <a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu/">University of Washington</a>. I am interested in building a mobile health application that can be easily and safely used by ordinary people. I am also passionate in extending the capability of the existing applications by augmenting ambient contexts. I achieve the goals by applying appropriate signal processing, computer vision, and machine learning techniques and employing HCI design process and usability evaluation.

Prior to UW CSE, I recieved BS and MS in Computer Science at <a href="http://cs.kaist.ac.kr/">KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology)</a>. I conducted research with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/wewantsj/">Sung-Ju Lee</a>, <a href="https://juhokim.com/">Juho Kim</a>, <a href="https://nclab.kaist.ac.kr/professor_page.html">Junehwa Song</a>, and <a href="http://an.kaist.ac.kr/~sbmoon/">Sue Moon</a>.
