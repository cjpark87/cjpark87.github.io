title: "Understanding People's Well-being from Passively Sensed Data"
collection: projects
excerpt: "Sleep is critical to human function, mediating factors like memory, mood, energy, and alertness. Although it is commonly conjectured that a good nightâ€™s sleep is important for job performance, this relationship has historically been hard to quantify due to the difficulty of capturing objective measures in real-world contexts. We have explored the relationship between sleep and job performance in the wild, and sleep and sleep tracking app. Also, we have also explored the feasiblity of using mobile app interaction time as an indicator of sleep behavior and job performance"
