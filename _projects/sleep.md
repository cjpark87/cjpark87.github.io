title: "Understanding Relationship between Sleep Tracking App, Sleep, and Job Performance"
collection: projects
excerpt: 'Sleep is critical to human function, mediating factors like memory, mood, energy, and alertness. Although it is commonly conjectured that a good night’s sleep is important for job performance, this relationship has historically been hard to quantify due to the difficulty of capturing objective measures in real-world contexts. We present an observational study in which we tracked the sleep behaviors of 274 participants who used a mattress sensor. For a subset of that population including salespeople (N=15) and athletes (N=19), we also track job performance through daily sales statistics and game-day ratings.We show that cumulative sleep measures were significantly correlated with job performance metrics. When the averagesalesperson lost one hour of sleep daily for one week, the number of contracts they were able to establish decreased by 9% thenext day; when the average athlete lost the same amount of sleep throughout the week, their game grades dropped by 9.5%.Because objective job performance metrics can be difficult to collect in practice, we investigate the utility of passively sensed,timed smartphone interactions as a performance indicator. Using a generalized additive model with per-user random effects,we find that our instantiation of an app-based performance metric—interaction time—exhibits correlations with sleep history,time awake, and circadian rhythms. We also show that interaction time is correlated with athletic job performance (ρ=-0.296,p=0.0456), revealing an opportunity for researchers to assess cognition and productivity in a continuous, nonintrusive manner.'
