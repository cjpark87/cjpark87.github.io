title: "Understanding Relationship between Sleep Tracking App, Sleep, and Job Performance"
collection: projects
excerpt: "Sleep is critical to human function, mediating factors like memory, mood, energy, and alertness. Although it is commonly conjectured that a good nightâ€™s sleep is important for job performance, this relationship has historically been hard to quantify due to the difficulty of capturing objective measures in real-world contexts. Through an observational study, we tracked participants sleep behaviors, sleep tracking app usage, and their job performance. With this dataset, we are exploring the relationship between sleep and job performance in the wild, and sleep and sleep tracking app. Also, we are exploring the feasiblity of using mobile app interaction time as an indicator of job performance by investigating how mobile app interaction time changes with participant's sleep behavior and circadian rhythms."
