title: "Augmenting Ambient Contexts to Various Applications"
collection: projects 
excerpt: "Context awareness provides better understanding of user, which can be used in many different ways. I've been exploring augmenting ambient acoustic contexts to conversational agents to extend the capability of the existing smart speakers. I've been also working on non-textual communication application that recommends avatars that represent user's current state so that users can simply select and tap to share their states with friends and family."
