title: "Augmenting Ambient Contexts to Various Applications"
collection: projects 
excerpt: "Context awareness provides better understanding of user, which can be used in many different ways. I've explore augmenting ambient acoustic contexts to conversational agents to extend the capability of the existing smart speakers.

Lastly, I've explored using users' subtle motion to provide seamless content sharing experience across different devices"
