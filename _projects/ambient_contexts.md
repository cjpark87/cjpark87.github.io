title: "Understanding and Augmenting Ambient Contexts to Various Applications"
collection: projects 
excerpt: 'Conversational agents are rich in content today. However, they areentirely oblivious to usersâ€™ situational context, limiting their ability to adapt their response and interaction style. Two critical challenges underpin this caveat - i) inferring contexts from acoustics in-the-wild is hard, and ii) these agents have tight latency requirements for fast responsiveness. To this end, we systematically explore the design space for a context augmented conversational agent, including analysis of input segment dynamics and computational alternatives. Building on these, we propose a solution that redesigns the input segment intelligently to accommodate acoustic-based context analysis, achieved in a two-step inference pipeline. First, we separate the non-speech segment from acoustic signals and thenuse a VGGish-based neural network architecture to infer diverse ambient contexts (e.g., crowd sounds, background chatter sounds,clapping sounds, etc.). The network uses a partial AudioSet dataset purposefully curated through crowdsourcing and containing vary-ing ambient acoustic events. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network can distinguish between different ambi-ent contexts with an averagae F-1 score of 0.79 and a computational latency of 3 milliseconds. We also reflect on a distilled version ofthis neural network, jointly optimized for recognition accuracy and latency. Finally, we present a concrete manifestation of our solutionin designing a context-aware conversational agent with kinetice arables'
